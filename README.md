## Introduction
This repository is the official implementation for "Integrality Capsule Learning Network for Breast Lesion Segmentation in Ultrasound Images".

## Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown substantial promise in medical image segmentation, but current methods often struggle with accurately delineating lesion regions, leading to incomplete boundaries or missed interior areas. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, Integrality Capsule Learning Network (ICLNet), designed specifically for the segmentation of breast lesions in ultrasound (BUS) images. ICLNet introduces two key innovations. First, we replace traditional skip connections in U-Net with a Residual Global Local Attention (RGLA) module, which enhances both global and local feature representation while preserving the original image features, thereby improving segmentation integrity. Second, inspired by capsule networks, we integrate a CapsDecoder module into the decoder, leveraging the ability of capsules to capture both local and global object features, further improving segmentation accuracy. Experimental results on the AMUBUS and BUSI datasets demonstrate that ICLNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for medical image segmentation.
